Perfect 💡 — that’s the right step. Before we code, let’s plan the full frontend structure and content flow.

Since this is AcadeX, a platform for exams, results, and school digitalization, we’ll treat this as a landing + access hub for schools, admins, and students.

🧱 FRONTEND STRUCTURE PLAN (for AcadeX Landing)
🌐 1. Main Landing Page Sections
Section	Description	Features / Content ideas
Hero Section	First impression — who we are, what we do	- Logo + tagline ("Digital Exams, Simplified")
- Short text: “AcadeX helps schools conduct secure online and offline exams with instant result processing.”
- “Get Started” / “Learn More” button
- Animated background (floating elements / student theme)
How It Works	Quick process overview	- 3 cards or steps:
① Create School
② Add Students & Exams
③ Conduct & Review Results
- Optional Lottie animations or icons
Features	Show key selling points	- Offline Exam Mode (No Internet? No Problem)
- Multi-school SaaS Setup
- Instant Result Computation
- Smart Resit Detection
- Student Data Sync
- Admin Dashboard
Why Choose Us / Benefits	Show advantages	- Security & Integrity
- Simple Interface
- Works Offline & Online
- Cloud Sync for Safety
Demo Preview / Screenshots	Visualize app	- Display app mockups (admin, student, exam screen)
- “View Live Demo” button
Testimonials (optional)	Social proof	- Placeholder for 2–3 quotes from schools/users
Call-to-Action (CTA)	End strong	- “Join the Future of Academic Testing”
- Buttons: “Get Started”
Footer	Navigation + contact	- © AcadeX
🧭 2. Navigation Bar

Logo (AcadeX)

Sections: Home | Features | How it Works | Contact

Buttons: Login / Get Started

🧑‍💻 3. Portal Links (Hidden or Footer)

Even though the superadmin shouldn’t be shown on landing:

We can keep hidden routes for:

/admin → Admin Login

/school → School Portal

/student → Student Login

(No “superadmin” shown in public)

🎨 4. Design Language

Color scheme: White background, Blue accent (#007bff or a custom lighter tone)

Font: Modern (e.g., Inter, Poppins, or Outfit)

Animations: Scroll fade-ins + floating elements on hero

Style: Flat, minimal, and professional (SaaS-grade UI)

⚙️ 5. Tech Setup

Framework: Next.js + Tailwind CSS

Animation: Framer Motion

Icons: Lucide React

Deployment: Vercel

📱 6. Responsive Views

Desktop: full layout with animations

Mobile: stacked sections, easy scroll

⚡ 7. Later Add-ons

When we evolve:

Add /docs (API or platform info)

Add /pricing (for schools’ subscription tiers)

Add /blog (for SEO)


Step 2 — Base Layout

We’ll create:

components/Navbar.tsx

components/Footer.tsx

components/SectionWrapper.tsx (for smooth fade-in animations)

app/page.tsx (the main landing page)

🧠 Step 3 — Content Sections (we’ll add one by one)

Each will use the blue-white minimal theme we discussed.
